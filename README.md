Welcome to the Discord Bot Dr. Zoidberg!

  This bot was developed to help you with the management of your Discord server. 
  Its my first discord bot and made with python. Here are some of its features:

    1. Serverinfo: This command provides you with detailed information about your server, including the number of members, channels, and roles.

    2. Admin.: This command allows you to perform administrative tasks, such as banning, kicking, and muting users.
    It also lists all  available admin commands.

    3. Help: This command provides you with a list of all available commands and a brief explanation of each command's function.

  Dr. Zoidberg is easy to use and offers a variety of useful features to manage your Discord server. Give it a try and experience how easy it can be!
