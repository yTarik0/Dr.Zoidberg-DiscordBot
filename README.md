Welcome to the Discord Bot Dr. Zoidberg!
Just started 1.5 weeks ago coding this bot just for fun.
Public-Source-Code!

  This bot was developed to help you with the management of your Discord server. 
  Its my first discord bot and made with python. Here are some of its features:

    1. Serverinfo: This command provides you with detailed information about your server, including the number of members, channels, and roles.

    2. Admin.: This command allows you to perform administrative tasks, such as banning, kicking, and muting users.
    It also lists all  available admin commands.

    3. Help: This command provides you with a list of all available commands and a brief explanation of each command's function.
    
    4. /chatai: You communicate with the AI "ChatGPT" from Discord.

  Dr. Zoidberg is easy to use and offers a variety of useful features to manage your Discord server. Give it a try and experience how easy it can be!
